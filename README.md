PLUGS is an Open Source Android application I built using Unity3D. Written in C#, PLUGS allows the user to use any mobile device as a quick and easy ground sensor.

Just Download the app, from the app store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.WizBang.PLUGS) or build to your device from Unity3d (Assets/Project/PLUGSProject/Scenes/StartScene 1). Once loaded enter a device name and choose to Host or Join a room.


If Hosting, you will have access to the Host Dashboard which displays all devices connected to your room. On the Host Dashboard, is an Alert panel which displays all alerts transmitted from the sensor devices. When the alerts are pressed, a dropdown will appear giving you options to interact with the alerting device. The Host Dashboard has a map displaying the location of each device when pressed the devices on the map will display the GPS location of the device. 

If Joining, your device will be turned into a sensor device. You will be presented with a menu of parameters in which you will choose what you would like your device to detect and how. You will also choose how you would like the host phone to be alerted and what other actions will take place.
